# Lab 5 Documentation + Verification TODO

## Pending (manual)
- [ ] [manual] Run `lab5.ipynb` end-to-end and confirm all figures save to `plots/final/`.

## Completed
- [x] Remove manifest generation and manifest files; keep results in `plots/final/part3_stats.csv`.
- [x] Update `README.md` with Part 2-3 protocol answers based on current plots and stats.
- [x] Trim `AGENTS.md` to reflect remaining verification work.
